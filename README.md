# Biometric-Fingerprint-Attendance-System
This is the code file for my embedded system project.
For Biometric Fingerprint Attendance System, you can use the following code: This repository contains three code files: the I2C LCD driver library for Raspberry Pi DLCD, the fingerprint sensor to register a new fingerprint, and the main code for my project, in which the fingerprint sensor is attached to the Raspberry Pi and an excel spreadsheet and an email are generated to record attendance.
